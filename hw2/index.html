		<h1> Overview </h1>
		<p>
			In this assignment, we have implemented a comprehensive suite of functions for rendering and modifying 3D meshes
			in ways that are relevant to the world of 3D graphics. We explore bezier curves, the halfedge data structure, and 
			how these concepts can be used to create a smooth mesh out of polygons.

		<h1>Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h1>
		<p> 
			As a first step, we implemented de Casteljau's algorithm for point interpolation 
			in the two-dimensional case, or a 1-D array of points. De Casteljau's algorithm is a useful tool 
			for rendering curves in that it allows a continuous curve to be represented using discrete control points, 
			which are evaluated to determine the actual positions of points along the curve during runtime. 
			Given that our function takes as input a number of control points and a position <b>t</b> to be 
			evaluated, we can perform interpolation as follows:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li> Given a list of control points <b>p_0</b>, <b>p_1</b>, <b>p_2</b>...</li>
			<li> While the number of control points is greater than 1: </li>
			<li> Interpolate the next set of control points by lerping <b>p_0</b> and <b>p_1</b>, <b>p_1</b> and <b>p_2</b>, etc... </li>
			<li> Use <b>t</b> and <b>1 - t</b> when determining the proportion of each point to use in the lerp </li>
			<li> Set this new set as our list of control points </li>
		</ul>

		<h1>Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h1>
		<p>
			Now we move on implementing bezier surfaces, represented by a 2D matrix of control points. 
			This allows us to render curvy shapes in 3D, though this presents the question of how to interpolate 
			points beloging to this bezier surface. We note that a 2D matrix of control points can be thought of 
			as N 1-D arrays of control points. Should we perform de Casteljau on each of these 1-D arrays, we are again 
			left with a single set of points that, through de Casteljau, gives us the point in 3D that we are looking for. 
			Thus, the case of bezier surfaces reduces nicely into the case of bezier curves. Our algorithm works as follows: 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li> Given a 2D matrix of contol points and coordinates <b>u, v</b> to evaluate... </li>
			<li> Evaluate each row of the matrix as a bezier curve using the algorithm from Part 1, with <b>t = u</b>, to yield a column of points </li>
			<li> Evaluate the column of points using the algorithm from Part 1, with <b>t = v</b>, to yield the final point </li>
		</ul>

		<h1>Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h1>
		<p> 
			Area-Weighted Vertex Normals are an important concept that allows for the rendering of smooth surfaces even when dealing with polygons, 
			through Phoong shading. In layman's terms, they can be thought of as the <i>"direction pointing out"</i> of each vertex of a mesh. Given 
			that this is so, it makes intuitive sense that this direction is based upon the <i>"outward facing direction"</i> of the faces neighboring 
			the vertex. Our algorithm aims to capture this relationship as follows: 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li> Given a point in a vertex: </li>
			<li> Iterate throigh all of its neighboring faces </li>
			<li> For each face, calculate its perpendicular vector by taking the cross product of two of its edges </li>
			<li> Sum up these vectors, and normalize it. The resulting vector is the area-weighted vertex normal </li>
		</ul>

		<h1>Part 4: Edge Flip</h1>
		<p>
			Edge flips are an important operation for triangle meshes to support, as they are one of the steps involed in upscaling a model, 
			which will be explored in-depth in a later part. This requires a comprehensive visual understanding of the data structure of each parameter of the Triangle. 
			A good visual understanding of the changes of them follow tidly to acheive the ideal result. To keep things organized, first all of the original 
			elements are listed out, then edited accoordingly. Next, we update pointers for all elements. 
		</p>

		<p><i>Our teapot represented before and after the flip.</i></p>
		<p>
			Debugging Journey: One debug issue encontered in this part concerntrated on the understanding of whether not it is necessary to create
			new halfedge(s). After debugging, we concluded that there is no need to create any new halfedges. Rather, we simply need to update pointers of the old halfedges.
		</p>

		<h1>Part 5: Edge Split</h1>
		<p>
			Edge splits are another important operation involved in upscaling. One way to think about edge splitting is that it takes an edge, creates the 
			edge that would result from a flip, but still preserves the original edge. This operation therefore creates another vertex as well, at the point 
			where the two edges intersect. To understand the steps necessary for a flip operation, we use another digram, shown below:
		</p>
		<img src="split.png" width="500" height="500">
		<p>
			With this diagram as our reference, we proceeded to implementing the operation by traversing the two triangles and finding all the mesh components to be 
			altered. We also created all of the mesh elements. We then methodically went about updating the pointers of every element, matching the relationships outlined 
			in the diagram.

		<h1>Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h1>
		<p> 
			Loop subdivision represents the culmination of our work from the previous two tasks. The ultimate goal of this task is to create a method that can 'upscale' 
			a mesh by using more triangle to represent the same features. The aim is to provide a smoother texture by upscaling a model until it is in a satisfactory state. 
			Our algorithm works as described:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Iterate through every current vertex in the mesh. Caculate and store, <b>but not set</b>, its new position. Also mark each vertex as old.</li>
			<li>Iterate throguh every old edge in the mesh. For each, split it, and mark the newly made vertex as new. Also mark blue edges from splitting.</li>
			<li>Iterate through every vertex, if the vertex is marked old, update its position using the stored position.</li>
			<li>Iterate through every edge. If the edge is blue, and connects and old and new vertex, flip it.</li>
			<li>Mark all mesh elements as old so prevent issues in future upscaling operations.</li>
		</ul>

		<p><i> 
			A cube model after multiple rounds of upscaling. As a result of upscaling, the positions of each vertex becomes influenced by one another through averaging, dulling sharp
			corners. Furthermore, adding more vertices to the mesh makes the contribution of each vertex less pronounced. We also observe that the shape of the cube becomes more asymetric.
		</i></p>
		<p>The way to maintain "sharpness" in an object is to preprocess the edges through a series of splits that creates more geometry aroumd the sharp regions of the mesh.</p>
		<p>We observe that we can preserve symmetry of a model by ensuring that the underlying is mesh edges are symmetrical as well.</p>
