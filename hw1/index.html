		<h1> Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h1>
		<p> 
			For this task, we are given as input 3 pairs of floats: <b>(x0, yo), (x1, y1), (x2, y2)</b> representing the coordinates of the three vertices of a triangle, 
			along with a Color <b>c</b>, representing the color of said triangle. Our final algorithm performs these steps:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li> Calculate the min of <b>(x0, x1, x2)</b> as <b>left_x</b></li>
			<li> Calculate the max of <b>(x0, x1, x2)</b> as <b>right_x</b></li>
			<li> Calculate the min of <b>(y0, y1, y2)</b> as <b>bottom_y</b></li>
			<li> Calculate the max of <b>(y0, y1, y2)</b> as <b>top_y</b></li>
			<li> Iterate through all coordinate combinations from <b>left_x</b> to <b>right_x</b>, and from <b>bottom_y</b> to <b>top_y</b>. For each...</li>
			<li> Perform the three line test to check if the center point is inside the triangle. If so, color the pixel at this coordinate with <b>c</b>.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The variables <b>left_x</b>, <b>bottom_y</b>, etc. represent the edges of the square which encapsulates the triangle. In other words, they 
			can be considered the bounds which are guaranteed to cover every point of the triangle. This makes our algorithm an implementation of bounding box.

			<li>Calculate the width/height of a sampling square given the current <b>sampling_rate</b>.</li>

			<li> Iterate through all sub-pixels in the pixel. For each...</li>
			<li> Perform the three line test to check if the center point is inside the triangle. If so, color the pixel at this coordinate with <b>c</b>. </li>

		<p> 
			Just as seen in Task 1, rendering artifacts like jaggies and disjoint components are a setback of using the basic sampling algorithm. 
			Supersampling seeks to address these artifacts by allowing for pixels to be be filled in "partially". Softer colors are used along the edges 
			to create a more seamless transition along the boundaries of two solid colors. As we increase the sampling rate, we observe tighter bounds along which 
			the softer colors are drawn.

		<h1> Task 4: Barycentric coordinates </h1>
		<p>
			Barycentric coordinates are a way of representing a point in a triangle as a set of distances from each of its vertices. 
			Each coordinate value ranges from 0 to 1, where a 0 indicates that the point lies on an edge formed by a given vertex, 
			and a 1 indicates that the point lies on the edge facing away from the given vertex. They are incredibly useful for rendering 
			as they allow us to utilize texture maps, as we will explore in Task 5.

		<h1> Task 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping </h1>
		<p> 
			Pixel sampling allows us to ascribe a <b>texture map</b> to a geometric object (composed of rasterizable triangles). 
			For this task, we are given the coordinates of a triangle in screen space <b>(x0, y0, x1, y1, x2, y2)</b>, the 
			coordinates of the same triangle in texture space <b>(u0, v0, u1, v1, u2, v2)</b>, and a texure <b>tex</b>. On a high level, 
			our goal is to take points inside the triangle in screen space, find their corresponding point on the texture map through 
			barycentric interpolation, and sample the color at that point to fill in our buffer. Our algorithm performs the calculations 
			necessary to achieve this goal:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li> For every point in the rasterized triangle... </li>
			<li> Calculate the barycentric coordinates of this point as <b>uv</b>. </li>
			<li> Sample the color in <b>tex</b> at point <b>uv</b> as <b>c</b>. </li>
			<li> Fill in the buffer spot corresponding to this point as <b>c</b>. </li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			We have to bear in mind that unless both coordinates of <b>uv</b> are integers, there will be no single point in <b>tex</b> that
			corresponds to <b>uv</b>. More likely, <b>uv</b> will fall somewhere between 4 points in <b>tex</b>. This is the motivation behind 
			the sampling techniques that we use to retrieve a color from the texture map. When it comes to sampling the color at a given point 
			in the texture map, there are two options that we choose from: <b>nearest neighbor</b> and <b>bilinear interpolation</b>. 
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>In <b>nearest neighbor</b> sampling, we determine which defined point in the texture map our uv value is closest to, and return the color at that point.</li>
			<li> In <b>bilinear interpolation</b> sampling, we use a series of 3 lerps to approximate the color of a point as a proportionate sum of its 4 nearest defined points.</li>
		</ul>
		<p> Though more computationally expensive, bilinear interpolation will often produce better results than nearest neighbor, as illustrated in the following example: </p>

		<img src="nn_16.png" width="375" height="300"> 
		<p><i> Nearest neighbor sampling with sampling rates of 1 and 16 respectively. Even with a sampling rate of 16, these lines of longitude still appear disjoint. </i></p>
		<img src="bi_1.png" width="375" height="300"> 
		<img src="bi_16.png" width="375" height="300"> 
		<p>
			<i> 
				Bilinear interpolation sampling with sampling rates of 1 and 16 respectively. Already we see that interpolating with a sampling rate of 1 defeats nearest 
				neighbor sampling by drawing longitude lines that are continuous. By increasing the sampling rate, the lines get drawn in a way that better captures their curved 
				shape.
			</i>
		</p>
		<p> 
			From this example, we can draw the conclusion that differences between the two methods will beomce most prevalent when sampling textures that feature high frequencies 
			(color which changes dramatically over a short distance). Bilinear interpolation addresses these high frequency shifts by approximating an intermediate color between 
			two colors which sharply contrast. In the map example, the high frequency change would be going from the blue ocean to the white longitude line.

		<h1> Task 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping </h1>
		<p> 
			<b>Level sampling</b> is a technique which aims to reduce aliasing in the sampling of a single texture, and is motivated by the observation that 
			objects which appear closer will appear to have a higher resolution than objects that appear further. To perform level sampling, we will store multiple
			"levels" of a single texture, each level representing a version of the texture that is of a lower resolution than the level before it. We have updated our 
			algorithm to calculate the level that should be used for each rendered point, where the final color that is sampled is based on which level sampling method 
			we use. We calculate the level for each pont as follows:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>For each point <b>(x, y)</b>...</li>
			<li>Calculate the coordinate one unit right as <b>(x_1, y)</b></li>
			<li>Calculate the coordinate one unit up as <b>(x, y_1)</b></li>
			<li> Calculate the uv coordinates of the three points as <b>uv_00, uv_10, uv_01</b> </li>
			<li> Calculate the distance from <b>uv_00</b> to <b>uv_10</b> as <b>right_dist</b> </li>
			<li> Calculate the distance from <b>uv_00</b> to <b>uv_01</b> as <b>up_dist</b> </li>
			<li> Calculate <b>D</b> as the square root of <b><i>max</i>(up_dist, right_dist)</b> </li>
			<li> Clamp <b>D</b> so that it is non-negative, and does not exceed our deepest level </li>
			<li> <b>D</b> now represents the level which should be used for this point </li>
		</ul>

		<p> 
			One observation is that <b>D</b> is not guaranteed to be an integer, which is to say that there is no guarantee that the point in question
			fits perfectly into a level that actually exists. Thus, we refer to one of our various level sampling techniques for addressing this. 
			We have three options to choose for level sampling techniques: <b>L_zero</b>, <b>L_nearest</b>, and <b>L_linear</b>.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li> <b>L_zero</b> produces the same result as if there was no leveling at all, since every point is treated as level zero. </li>
			<li> <b>L_nearest</b> rounds level value to the nearest integer (i.e. 3.6 uses level 4, and 2.1 uses level 2). </li>
			<li> 
				<b>L_linear</b> uses a lerp to approximate the color that between two levels as a proportinate sum (i.e. 3.6 uses 60% of level 3, and 
				40% of level 4).
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			In terms of speed, <b>L_zero</b> is the fastest as it is equivalent to the case of no level samplin, followed by <b>L_nearest</b> which 
			requires reading one texture map, with <b>L_linear</b> as the slowest, having to read two texture maps.
		</p>
		<p>
			In terms of memory usage, <b>L_zero</b> is the cheapest as it only requires storing a single texture map. <b>L_nearest</b> and <b>L_linear</b> are 
			equally expensive as they both require the storing of <i><b>N</b></i> texture maps, where <i><b>N</b></i> is the total number of levels we want.
		</p>
		<p>
			In terms of aliasing prowress, <b>L_zero</b> is the weakest as it assumes the same frequency across all samples. <b>L_nearest</b> is second best, as it 
			allows for high frequencies to be filtered out to an extent based on level. <b>L_linear</b> will usually provide the best results, as interpolation is 
			a powerful tool which allows for us to calculate an intermediary color in cases where there are high frequency changes.

		<p><i> Even when switching to <b>P_linear</b>, the aliasing issue persists. </i></p>
		<img src="near_near.png" width="375" height="300"> 
		<p>
			<i> 
				Switching over to <b>L_near</b> and <b>P_near</b>, we notice a drastic imporvement with much smoother visuals. This illustrates that our 
				choice of level sampling technique played a bigger role than out choice of texture sampling technique.
			</i>
		</p>
		<img src="near_linear.png" width="375" height="300">
		<p>
			<i> 
				Finally, by reintroducing <b>P_linear</b>, we create an even smoother result. In conclusion, for certain situations, level sampling techniques can 
				deliever more major improvements, while texture sampling offers more fine-grain improvements.
