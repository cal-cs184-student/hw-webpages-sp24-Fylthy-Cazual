		<h1>Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h1>
		<p>
			From experimenting with various spring constant values for <i>ks</i>, we 
			see that it affects the "stiffness" of the cloth. We observe greater creasing 
			and draping patterns when the value of <i>ks</i> is low, while they are much less 
			prevalent when <i>ks</i> is high, which is to say that the cloth tends to maintain 
			its original shape.
		</p>

				<td><img src="high_ks.png" width="300"></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Low <i>ks</i></td>
				<td>High <i>ks</i></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>
			On the other hand, density has the inverse affect. Low values for density lead to a stiffer 
			cloth, and high density values leads to more dynamic creasing.

		<p>
			Damping seems to drive how fast the cloth converges into its resting state when presented with 
			a change. Lower damping values lead to faster convergence while higher damping values lead to slower 
			convergence. One tradeoff of speeding up the convergence speed is that the transition appears less "fluid" 
			with more noticeable jittering effects.

		<h1>Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h1>

				<td><i>ks</i> = 5000</td>
				<td><i>ks</i> = 50000</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>
			As <i>ks</i> increases, the shape of the cloth is less affected by the shape of the sphere. 
			This matches the observations made in the previous part, where we find that increasing ks 
			makes the cloth behave as if it was "stiffer". When <i>ks</i> = 500, the cloth wraps itself 
			tightly around the sphere. At <i>ks</i> = 50000, the cloth rests awkwardly atop the sphere with 
			its corners protruding outwards.

			Lower <i>ks</i> values results in fewer but larger ripples, whereas high

		<p>
			Lower density values lead to larger ripples, whereas higher density values leads to 
			smaller but more frequent ripples. Compared to <i>ks</i>, density changes have less of 
			an effect on the more granular level ossicilations within the cloth, as we the "bump" 
			patterns in the above images are not present here.

		<h1>Part 5: Shaders</h1>
		<p>
			In this part of the project we implement vertex and fragment shaders to create a variety 
			of textures on our objects. Vertex shaders allow for "bump" mapping, in which textures with 
			roughness or ridges can be simulated with slight vertex displacements. Fragment shaders work by 
			using an algorithm to calculate the color that each face of a cloth should have.
		</p>
		<p>
			Blinn-Phong shaders allow for objects to take on a metallic luster effect. This means applying 
			a fixed additional amount of luminance on top of the regular diffuse luminance, as well as another 
			layer of spectal luminance that is dependent on the observer's viewing angle.
		</p>

		</table>
		<p>
			Displacement mapping creates a more realistic representation of the texture's more 
			minute features by modifying the geomtery of the cloth itself. However, this consequently 
			also leads to different spring interactions and collision interactions with objects. 
			In contrast, bump mapping maintains the same shape as other types of rendering. Increasing 
			mesh coarseness leads to less "sliding" when collisions occur. This leads to faster convergence 
			as well as a lower likelihood of objects "sliding" off one another.
